# Measure your golden signals with GKE Managed Prometheus and the nginx-ingress

This repository contains a JSON export of a Google Cloud Monitoring Dashboard. The dashboard shows how you can display the [golden signals]((https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)) extracted from the [nginx-ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/). The nginx metrics are scraped using [Managed Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus).
